Apitally is built with a strong focus on data privacy. We hold ourselves accountable to the following principles:

- Only collect required data and nothing more
- Features with the potential to collect sensitive data need explicit user opt-in
- Provide extensive configuration options to control data collection, masking, and filtering
- Full transparency about what data is collected and how it's handled

## Data transit

Apitally uses HTTPS and TLS to send data from your application, running the Apitally SDK, to our servers.

## Data storage

Apitally stores data in a ClickHouse database hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> in the US. The underlying block storage volume is encrypted at rest.

Database backups are created hourly and are stored in a private <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces" target="_blank">Spaces</a> bucket. Data in Spaces is also encrypted at rest.

## Data retention

Apitally retains aggregated metrics for 13 months, allowing users to analyze long-term trends. Request and application log data is retained for 15 days.

When an app is deleted in the Apitally dashboard, all associated data is deleted from the database, but is still included in previously created backups.

Database backups are kept for 7 days.
