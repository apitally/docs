description: "How Apitally handles data collection, storage, and retention."
---

Apitally is built with a strong focus on data privacy. We hold ourselves to these principles:

- Collect only the data that's required, and nothing more
- Require explicit user opt-in for any feature that could capture sensitive data
- Offer extensive configuration options to control data collection, masking, and filtering
- Provide full transparency about what data is collected and how it's handled

Because all Apitally SDKs are open-source, you can also verify yourself how they work and what data they collect.

## Data collection

This is a complete overview of the data points collected by Apitally.

### Application metadata

The following data is collected once on application startup.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Endpoints">
    HTTP method and path of all routes registered in your application.

    Example:

    ```json
    [
      {"method": "GET", "path": "/v1/orders"},
      {"method": "GET", "path": "/v1/orders/{orderId}"},
      {"method": "POST", "path": "/v1/orders"}
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Versions">
    Versions of the Apitally SDK, your framework and runtime.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "apitally": "0.21.3",
      "fastapi": "0.121.1",
      "starlette": "0.49.3",
      "python": "3.13.9"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Metrics & analytics

The following data is collected for each request handled by your application and immediately aggregated on the client-side.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HTTP method and path">
    Method and path of the endpoint that handled the request.

    Example: `POST /v1/orders`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response status code">
    Status code of the response.

    Example: `200 OK`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request size">
    Size of the request body. Recorded as a histogram in 1 KB buckets.

    Example: `5 KB`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response size">
    Size of the response body. Recorded as a histogram in 1 KB buckets.

    Example: `5 KB`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response time">
    Time elapsed between start and finish of the route handler invokation for the request. Recorded as a histogram in 10 ms buckets.

    Example: `80 ms`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consumer" icon="shield">
    Consumer identifier, and optionally name and group, as provided by your own implementation.

    *Optional. Potentially sensitive (PII).*

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "identifier": "john.doe@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "group": "Users"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Request logs

The following data is collected for each request handled by your application, if request logging is enabled.

<AccordionGroup>

    Method and path of the endpoint that handled the request.

    Example: `POST /v1/orders`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="URL">
    The full request URL.

    Query parameters can be stripped by disabling `log_query_params`. Default masking rules apply to query parameters. Additional masking rules can be specified using `mask_query_params`.

    Example: `https://api.example.com/v1/books?search=api+design`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response status code">
    Status code of the response.

    Example: `200 OK`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request size">
    Size of the request body.

    Example: `4786 bytes`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request headers" icon="shield">
    Request headers.

    Only collected if enabled via `log_request_headers`. Default masking rules apply. Additional masking rules can be specified using `mask_headers`.

    *Optional. Potentially sensitive (secrets, PII).*

    Example:

    ```
    Host: api.example.com
    Authorization: ******
    X-Real-Ip: 147.98.24.101
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response size">
    Size of the response body.

    Example: `4678 bytes`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response time">
    Time elapsed between start and finish of the route handler invokation for the request.

    Example: `82 ms`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consumer" icon="shield">
    Consumer identifier, and optionally name and group, as provided by your own implementation.

    *Optional. Potentially sensitive (PII).*

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "identifier": "john.doe@example.com",

## Data transit

Apitally uses HTTPS and TLS to send data from your application, running the Apitally SDK, to our servers.

## Data storage

Apitally stores data in a ClickHouse database hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> in the US. The underlying block storage volume is encrypted at rest.

Database backups are created hourly and are stored in a private <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces" target="_blank">Spaces</a> bucket. Data in Spaces is also encrypted at rest.

## Data retention

Apitally retains aggregated metrics for 13 months, allowing you to analyze long-term trends. Request and application log data is retained for 15 days.

When an app is deleted in the Apitally dashboard, all associated data is deleted from the database, but is still included in previously created backups.

Database backups are kept for 7 days.

## Compliance

Apitally currently doesn't hold certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, and is not HIPAA compliant yet.

Please <a href="mailto:support@apitally.io">reach out</a> if you need help documenting Apitally as a vendor for your own compliance requirements.
