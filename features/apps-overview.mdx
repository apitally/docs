When you open the Apitally dashboard, you first land on the *Apps* page.
Here you see an overview of key API metrics for all your applications, including sparkline graphs that help you quickly identify unexpected spikes or drops.
Clicking on a metric or graph takes you to the relevant dashboard with more details.

You can also create, edit and delete apps on this screen.

## Environments

Each app in Apitally can have multiple environments, allowing you to track API metrics separately for production, staging, development, etc.

You can manage environments when creating or editing an app. You can also reorder environments so they're always displayed in an order that makes sense to you, e.g. `production` > `staging` > `development`.

If Apitally receives data from a new environment that doesn't exist yet, it is created automatically.

## Creating apps

<div className="flex flex-row justify-between gap-4" style={{ margin: "-1rem 0" }}>

</div>

Adding a new app to Apitally is very straightforward. Simply specify a name, select the framework used by your app and hit *Submit*.
You can optionally add or remove environments as appropriate for your app.

<Tip>
If you're using the Sentry SDK in your application, you can provide your organization slug and project name, so Apitally can link captured server errors to issues created in Sentry.

After submitting, you will see tailored setup instructions for your specific framework. These include code snippets you can copy and paste into your application code.
