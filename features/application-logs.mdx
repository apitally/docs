The Apitally SDKs can instrument various logging libraries to automatically capture logs emitted by your application during request handling.
These are associated with the corresponding request and displayed in the details modal of the request logs.

Log capture must be explicitly enabled alongside request logging. See example in the [setup guide](/setup-guides) for your framework.
