Apitally allows you to track API adoption by consumers and helps you understand how individual consumers interact with your API.

<Tip>
  To use this feature, your application must provide a consumer identifier for each request. Check out the [setup guide](/quickstart) for your framework to learn more (it's easy!).
</Tip>

The chart at the top of the *Consumers* page shows the number of unique API consumers that have interacted with your API over time, broken down by new and returning consumers.
You can select from different time periods in the dropdown above, and filter by environment.

Below the chart you'll find a list of all API consumers, including traffic sparkline graphs for a quick overview of traffic patterns, number of requests, error rates and the time of the last request.
From there, you can navigate to different dashboards filtered to a specific API consumer or consumer group.

## Consumer groups

You also have the option to create and analyze groups of consumers.
For example, if you have both internal and external API consumers, you could create two groups to understand their API usage separately.

<Note>
  Each API consumer can only be assigned to one group at a time. Assigning a consumer to a new group will remove it from their current group.
</Note>

You can choose between viewing individual API consumers and consumer groups on the *Consumers* page using the toggle at the top of the page.

The traffic, errors and performance dashboards include an option to filter by consumer groups too.
