Apitally allows you to track API adoption and helps you understand how individual consumers use your API.

<Tip>
  To use this feature, your application must provide a consumer identifier for each request. Check out the setup guide for your framework to learn how to do this.
</Tip>

The chart at the top of the *Consumers* page shows the number of unique API consumers that have made requests to your API over time, broken down by new and returning consumers.
You can select from different time periods in the dropdown above, and filter by environment.

The table below the chart lists all API consumers, including sparkline graphs for a quick overview of their requests.
You can click on the graph to navigate to the [traffic dashboard](/features/traffic-dashboard), filtered to the selected consumer.

## Consumer groups

You also have the option to create and analyze groups of consumers.
For example, if you have both internal and external API consumers, you could create two groups to understand their API usage separately.

<Note>
  Each API consumer can only be assigned to one group at a time. Assigning a consumer to a new group will remove it from their current group.
</Note>

You can choose between viewing individual API consumers and consumer groups on the *Consumers* page using the toggle at the top of the page.
