When a request takes longer than expected, traces help you understand exactly where the time is being spent.
Whether it's a slow database query, an external API call, or a custom operation in your code, traces provide the visibility you need to identify and resolve bottlenecks.

If enabled, you'll find traces in the request details in the request logs.

A trace consists of one or more spans, each representing an operation such as a database query or HTTP call.
Spans are visualized as horizontal bars, with their width reflecting their duration relative to the total response time of the request.

Click on a span to view its attributes in the table below, which can include details such as the database query, the HTTP method and URL of an external request, or any custom attributes your instrumentation has added.

## Enable tracing

Tracing must be explicitly enabled in your application alongside request logging.
The Apitally SDKs integrate with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and capture any spans created during request handling.

See the [setup guide](/setup-guides) for your framework to learn how to enable tracing and instrument libraries like database drivers and HTTP clients.
