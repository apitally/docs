The request log allows you to see a chronological list of all requests made to your API, allowing you to inspect details such as the request URL, headers, payloads and more.

Clicking on the timeline graph at the top allows you to quickly jump to a specific time point.

<Tip>Hold down the Cmd/Alt key and drag on the chart to zoom to a time range.</Tip>

## Enable logging

By default, our SDKs do not send request logs to Apitally.
You must explicitly enable logging in your application, and configure which aspects of the request and response you want to include.
There are also various options for excluding or masking sensitive data.

Learn more in the setup guide for your specific framework.
