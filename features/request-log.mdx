The request log allows you to see a chronological list of all requests made to your API, allowing you to inspect details such as the request URL, headers, payloads and more.

Clicking on the timeline graph at the top allows you to quickly jump to a specific time point.

<Tip>Hold down the Cmd/Alt key and drag on the chart to zoom to a time range.</Tip>

## Enable logging

By default, our SDKs do not send request logs to Apitally.
You must explicitly enable logging in your application, and configure which aspects of the request and response you want to include.
There are also various options for excluding or masking sensitive data.

Learn more in the setup guide for your specific framework.

## Filtering options

The filter panel offers many options to filter and search the request log to find the requests you're interested in.

- HTTP method
- Endpoint path
- Response status code
- Consumer / consumer group
- URL (partial match)
- Request / response payload (partial match)
- Request / response size
- Response time

## Request details

Clicking on a request in the log opens a modal with more detailed information, including parameters, headers, payloads, and more.

The request log includes a button to export logged requests to a CSV file. The exported file can include up to 1 million requests.
