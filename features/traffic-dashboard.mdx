The Traffic dashboard provides insights into the overall traffic to your API as well as usage of each API endpoint.

## Traffic metrics

The top section of the dashboard focuses on the following API metrics:

- Total requests (broken down by response status code on hover)
- Requests per minute (RPM)
- Error rate
- Data transferred (received and sent)

Clicking on the metrics toggles between different charts showing trends over time.

## Endpoints table

The table lists all endpoints of your API along with their traffic metrics. The Apitally SDKs use introspection to discover all endpoints defined in your application, even if they haven't been called yet.

By default, the table is ordered by request count, with the most used endpoint at the top. It can be searched and sorted by any of the other metrics too.

Clicking on an endpoint in this table opens a modal with detailed [endpoint insights](/features/endpoint-insights).

<Tip>A red triangle with an exclamation mark next to the error rate indicates that server errors have occurred on that endpoint.</Tip>

## Filters

The dashboard includes a range of filters to help you focus on the data most relevant to you.

<Tip>Applied filters are persistent, so they will remain active when you navigate to another dashboard.</Tip>

### Time period

You can view data for a specific time period using several methods:

- Select a standard period (e.g. *24 hours* or *30 days*) from the dropdown menu.
- Click and drag across the chart to select a custom range.
- Click a single bar on the chart to focus on that interval.
- Choose *Custom* from the dropdown to manually enter a start and end date.

### Environment

By default, the dashboard displays metrics from all environments. To view data for a specific environment, select it from the environment filter dropdown.

### Filter pane

Clicking the *Filter* button opens a side pane with additional filtering options:

- HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`)
- Endpoint path (supports wildcards)
- Response status code (e.g. `200`, `4xx`)
- API consumer or consumer group

### Save filters

You can save filters to quickly switch between different views. Saved filters can be shared with other team members.


## Exclude endpoints

Endpoints that are called frequently by automated services, such as health checks, can skew your metrics and hide important insights from real API consumers. You can exclude these endpoints from metrics calculations by opening the *Endpoint settings* from the dropdown menu in the endpoints table and toggling on *Exclude requests*.

## Export data

The dashboard includes a button to export the underlying data to a CSV file.
Current filters are applied automatically. Data can be aggregated in hourly or daily intervals.
