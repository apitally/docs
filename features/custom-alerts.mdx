Apitally allows you to automatically monitor API metrics and get notified when they breach a configured threshold.
This eliminates the need to manually check the dashboard and provides a first line of defense against potential issues.

## Creating alerts

You can create a new custom alert in these simple steps:

1. Choose a name for your alert, and optionally add a description. Both will be shown in alert notifications to help you quickly figure out what's going on.
2. Select the app and the environment you want to monitor.
3. Select the metric you want to monitor and set the threshold value and condition (e.g. "greater than 100"). See below for a list of available metrics.
4. Choose an aggregation window and the frequency at which the alert condition should be evaluated.

There are additional options available for more complex alerting needs, such as filtering, cron scheduling and delaying notifications. These are described in the sections below.

### Available metrics

- Requests per minute
- Total requests
- Data transferred (requests and responses)
- Data sent (responses)
- Data received (requests)
- Consumers (unique)
- Errors (client & server errors)
- Client errors
- Server errors
- Error rate
- Response time p50
- Response time p75
- Response time p95
- Apdex score

### Filtering options

You can narrow down the scope of your alerts using the following filters:

- *Consumer:* Monitor a specific API consumer.
- *Consumer group:* Track metrics for a group of consumers.
- *Endpoint:* Alert on a specific API endpoint.
- *Endpoint group:* Monitor a group of endpoints.

These filters can be found under *Additional filters* when creating or editing an alert.

### Cron scheduling

While the default check frequency is set using the *Check every* field, you can define more complex schedules using [cron expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression) under the *Advanced options* section.
The cron schedule will override the basic check frequency when specified.

Examples of cron expressions:

- `*/5 9-17 * * 1-5`: Check every 5 minutes between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays.
- `5 * * * *`: Check 5 minutes past the hour every hour.
- `0 9 * * *`: Check every day at 9 AM.

<Tip>You can write and test your cron expressions on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/).</Tip>

### Tuning notifications

Apitally provides several options for controlling the frequency and timing of alert notifications:

- *Aggregation window:* Define the time period over which metrics are aggregated during evaluation. Selecting a longer period can smooth out transient spikes.
- *Check every / Cron schedule for checks:* Set how often or when exactly to evaluate the alert conditions.
- *Notify after triggered:* Control how long a threshold must be breached before sending notifications.
- *Notify after resolved:* Specify when to send resolution notifications after conditions return to normal. This can reduce noise when conditions fluctuate around the threshold.

Tuning these settings helps prevent alert fatigue from transient issues while ensuring you're notified of persistent problems.

## Slack integration

Apitally integrates with Slack to send alert notifications to a channel in your Slack workspace.
To set up the Slack integration, navigate to the *Settings* page and select *Configure integrations*.

## Microsoft Teams integration

Apitally also offers an integration with Microsoft Teams for alert notifications using the Incoming Webhook connector.
To set this up, navigate to the *Settings* page, select *Configure integrations* and then follow the instructions on the screen.
