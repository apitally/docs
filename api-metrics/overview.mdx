When you open the Apitally dashboard, you first land on the *Apps* page.
Here you see an overview of key API metrics for all your applications, including sparkline graphs that help you quickly identify unexpected spikes or drops.

Clicking on a metric or graph takes you to the relevant dashboard with more details:
