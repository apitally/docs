The *Resources* dashboard displays your application's CPU and memory usage over time.
This data is collected automatically by the Apitally SDK and aggregated across all running instances within each environment.

Each chart displays the average value as a line and the range between minimum and maximum values as a shaded area.
The current average and maximum values are shown in the top-right corner of each chart.

## CPU utilization

The CPU utilization chart shows the percentage of CPU time used by your application process.
Since this is measured per-process and not relative to available cores, the value can exceed 100% for multi-threaded applications utilizing multiple CPU cores.

## Memory usage

The memory usage chart displays the resident set size (RSS) of your application process, which represents the actual physical memory being used.

## Overlay traffic

Toggle *Overlay traffic* to display a requests per minute area chart overlaid on the resource charts.
This helps you identify how spikes in API traffic affect CPU and memory usage.
