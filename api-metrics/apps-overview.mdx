When you open the Apitally dashboard, you first land on the *Apps* page.
Here you see an overview of key API metrics for all your applications, including sparkline graphs that help you quickly identify unexpected spikes or drops.
Clicking on a metric or graph takes you to the relevant dashboard with more details.

You can also create, edit and delete apps on this screen.
