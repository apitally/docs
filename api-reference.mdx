The Apitally API lets you programmatically access request logs and traffic metrics for your apps. Use it to export data for analysis, or integrate with your own systems.

<Info>API acccess requires the Premium plan.</Info>

## Endpoints

- [List apps](/api-reference/apps/list-apps): Retrieve all apps in your team.
- [List consumers](/api-reference/consumers/list-consumers): Retrieve all consumers for an app.
- [Get request logs](/api-reference/request-logs/get-request-logs): Retrieve request log data for an app.
- [Get traffic](/api-reference/traffic/get-traffic): Retrieve aggregated traffic metrics for an app.

## Authentication

The API uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the `Api-Key` header.

```bash
curl -H "Api-Key: your-api-key" https://api.apitally.io/v1/apps
```

You can manage API keys in the Apitally dashboard under **Settings > API keys**. Keys are scoped to a team and grant access to all apps within that team.

## Rate limits

The API allows up to 100 requests per minute per API key. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed per minute
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the limit resets

If you exceed the limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Pagination

Endpoints that return lists use cursor-based pagination. Responses include:

- `data`: Array of items for the current page
- `has_more`: Boolean indicating whether more items exist
- `next_token`: Token to fetch the next page (only present if `has_more` is `true`)

Use the `limit` query parameter to control page size (default 100, max 1000). To fetch the next page, pass the `next_token` value from the previous response:

```bash
curl -H "Api-Key: your-api-key" \
  "https://api.apitally.io/v1/apps/123/request-logs?limit=100&next_token=abc123"
```
