Logging of individual requests and responses is disabled by default to protect potentially sensitive data.
If you enable it, you can configure in detail what parts of the request and response should be logged.
You can also mask sensitive information (e.g. in headers) and exclude certain requests from logging.

The SDK applies [default masking rules](/data-privacy#data-masking) for common sensitive headers, query parameters and request/response body fields.
