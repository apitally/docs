<Info>
The request log is an opt-in feature available on our paid plans only.
</Info>

Logging of individual requests and responses is disabled by default to protect potentially sensitive data.
You can enable it by providing a `RequestLoggingConfig` object, which allows you to configure in detail what parts of the request and response should be logged.
There are also options for masking sensitive information and excluding certain requests from logging.
