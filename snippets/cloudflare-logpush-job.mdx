Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to _Analytics & Logs > Logpush_. Create a [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/logpush/) job with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Destination | HTTP destination |
| HTTP endpoint | `https://hub.apitally.io/v2/{client-id}/{env}/logpush` |
| Dataset | Workers trace events |
| If logs match... | Filtered logs: <br /> EventType equals `fetch` and <br /> ScriptName equals `{your-worker-name}` |
| Send the following fields... | General: <br /> Event, EventTimestampMs, Logs |

In the HTTP endpoint, replace `{client-id}` with your app's client ID and `{env}` with the environment (e.g. `prod` or `dev`). In the filter criteria, replace `{your-worker-name}` with the name of your Worker, as specified in your Wrangler config.
