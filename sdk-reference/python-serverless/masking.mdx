import DefaultMaskingAndExclusion from '/snippets/default-masking-and-exclusion.mdx';

The Apitally Serverless SDK captures details about each request and response handled by your application. To protect sensitive data and reduce noise, the SDK provides mechanisms for masking data and filtering out requests you don't want to log.


## Default masking and exclusion

## Masking sensitive data

You can extend the default masking rules by providing additional regular expressions via the `mask_query_params`, `mask_headers`, and `mask_body_fields` parameters. Patterns are case-insensitive and match anywhere within the name. Use `^` and `$` anchors for exact matches.

```python Configuration example {10-13}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apitally_serverless.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    log_request_headers=True,
    log_request_body=True,
    log_response_body=True,
    # Mask specific query parameters, headers and body fields
    mask_query_params=[r"^card_number$", r"^account_id$"],
    mask_headers=[r"^X-Custom-Key$", r"^X-Internal-"],
    mask_body_fields=[r"^credit_card$", r"social_security"],
)
```

## Excluding requests

You can exclude requests from logging using path patterns (regular expressions) via the `exclude_paths` parameter. Like the masking patterns, these are case-insensitive and match anywhere within the request path. Use `^` and `$` anchors for exact matches.

```python Configuration example {10-11}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apitally_serverless.fastapi import ApitallyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    ApitallyMiddleware,
    log_request_headers=True,
    log_request_body=True,
    log_response_body=True,
    # Exclude paths matching certain patterns
    exclude_paths=[r"/admin/", r"/internal/"],
)
```

<Note>
  Excluded requests won't be logged, but are still counted in metrics. To exclude endpoints from metrics, you can mark them as excluded in the [dashboard](/features/traffic-dashboard#exclude-endpoints).
