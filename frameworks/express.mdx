This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Express](https://expressjs.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="Express" />

## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="Express" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-express.webp)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

Next, install the [Apitally SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apitally) in your Express project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install apitally
```

```shell yarn
yarn add apitally
```
</CodeGroup>

Add the Apitally middleware to your Express application using the `useApitally` function and provide the `clientId` for your app.
You'll find the `clientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ESM
import express from "express";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```

```javascript CommonJS
const express = require("express");
const { useApitally } = require("apitally/express");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Identify consumers

<Snippet file="identify-consumers.mdx" />

To associate requests with consumers, set the `apitallyConsumer` property on the [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) in a middleware.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Example
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.apitallyConsumer = req.user.username
  }
  next()
})
```

```javascript Example for TypeScript
import type { Request } from "express";

declare module "express" {
  interface Request {
    apitallyConsumer?: string;
  }
}

app.use(function (req: Request, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.apitallyConsumer = req.user.username
  }
  next()
})
```
</CodeGroup>

<ConsumerIdentifierSnippet />

<Snippet file="identify-consumers-check.mdx" />

## Name and group consumers

<ConsumerNameGroupSnippet language="javascript" />

```javascript
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.apitallyConsumer = {
      identifier: req.user.username,
      name: `${req.user.first_name} ${req.user.last_name}`,
      group: req.user.group,
    }
  }
  next()
})
```

## Capture server errors

The Apitally SDK installs an error handler that captures server error details automatically.
It is added to the bottom of the middleware stack.

However, if your application already has custom error handlers that return a response and don't call `next(err)`, you need to add the following line of code for Apitally to capture server error details.

```javascript {2}
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.locals.serverError = err;
  // Your custom error handling logic ...
});
```

## Configure request logging

<RequestLoggingConfigSnippet language="javascript" />

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Basic example
import express from "express";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  requestLoggingConfig: {
    enabled: true,
    logQueryParams: true,
    logRequestHeaders: true,
    logRequestBody: true,
    logResponseHeaders: true,
    logResponseBody: true,
  },
});
```

```javascript Advanced example
import express from "express";
import { useApitally } from "apitally/express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

useApitally(app, {
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  env: "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  requestLoggingConfig: {
    enabled: true,
    logQueryParams: true,
    logRequestHeaders: true,
    logRequestBody: true,
    logResponseHeaders: true,
    logResponseBody: true,
    // Mask some query parameters with sensitive information
    maskQueryParams: [/^card_number$/i],
    // Mask custom header with sensitive information (applied to both request and response headers)
    // Common sensitive headers like `Authorization` are masked by default
    maskHeaders: [/^X-Sensitive-Header$/i],
    // Only log request body for some parts of the API
    maskRequestBodyCallback: (request) => request.path?.startsWith("/api/v2") ? request.body : null,
    // Only log response body for unsuccessful requests
    maskResponseBodyCallback: (request, response) => response.statusCode >= 400 ? response.body : null,
    // Exclude some paths from request logging (common health check paths are excluded by default)
    excludePaths=[/\/metrics$/],
    // Exclude requests from a specific consumer
    excludeCallback: (request, response) => request.consumer == "some-consumer",
  },
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Known issues

- `@sentry/node` v7 is incompatible with Apitally. It's instrumentation logic erases metadata on Express routers that Apitally requires. To resolve this, please upgrade `@sentry/node` to v8.
