This page guides you through the steps of configuring your [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com) application to work with Apitally. If you don't have an account yet, now would be a good time to [sign up](https://app.apitally.io/?signup).

<SetupGuideStartSnippet framework="Gin" />

## Create app

<CreateAppSnippet1 framework="Gin" />

![Create app](https://assets.apitally.io/docs/create-app-gin.webp)

<CreateAppSnippet2 />

## Add middleware

Add the [Apitally SDK](https://github.com/apitally/apitally-go) to the dependencies in your Gin project.

```shell
go get github.com/apitally/apitally-go/gin
```

Add the Apitally middleware to your Gin application and provide the `ClientId` for your app.
You'll find the `ClientId` on the _Setup instructions_ page for your app in the Apitally dashboard, which is displayed immediately after creating the app.

```go
package main

import (
  apitally "github.com/apitally/apitally-go/gin"
  "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
  r := gin.Default()

  config := &apitally.ApitallyConfig{
    ClientId: "your-client-id",
    Env:      "dev", // or "prod" etc.
  }
  apitally.UseApitally(r, config)

  // ... rest of your code ...
}
```
