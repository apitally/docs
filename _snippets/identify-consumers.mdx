To analyze and filter API traffic by consumers, you can associate requests with consumer identifiers in your application.

In most cases, use the authenticated identity to identify the consumer.
The identifier should be a string, such as a username, email address, or any other unique identifier.

Optionally, you can also provide a display name and group for each consumer.
